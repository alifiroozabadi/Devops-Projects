## Prerequisites

Before using this Terraform configuration, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Terraform**: Install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from [Terraform's official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

2. **VMware vSphere**: Access to a VMware vSphere environment, including vCenter Server, ESXi hosts, and appropriate permissions to create VMs.

3. **Terraform Variables**: Customize the variables in the `variable.tf` file according to your environment and infrastructure requirements.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with provisioning infrastructure using Terraform:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alifiroozabadi/Devops-Projects
   cd Project1/taks1
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform:**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Review and Adjust Variables:**

   Open the `variable.tf` file and review the variables. Adjust them to match your specific environment, such as vSphere credentials, network settings, and VM configurations.

4. **Plan and Apply:**

   Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes that Terraform will make:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   If the plan looks correct, apply the changes:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Verify Infrastructure:**

   After applying the changes, verify that the infrastructure has been provisioned as expected in your VMware environment.

## Usage

Describe how to use the infrastructure provisioned by this Terraform configuration. Include any specific instructions for accessing VMs, applications, or services deployed.

## Variables

Explain the purpose and usage of the variables defined in the `variable.tf` file. Provide examples of how to customize these variables for different scenarios.
